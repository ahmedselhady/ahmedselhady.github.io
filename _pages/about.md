I am a PhD Research Student at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) under the supervision of [**Mikel Artetxe**](https://www.mikelartetxe.com/) and [**Eneko Agirre**](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=kSuqts0AAAAJ&hl=en).

I am working on the analysis and improvement of multi-lingual capabilities in Large Language Models.

Before embarking on my PhD, I worked as an Applied Data Scientist at **Microsoft Bing's** news and content moderation and understanding (now part of web and windows experience). I also worked as an Applied Data Scientist at **Agolo**, a Microsoft-backed startup, where I worked on multiple projects building summarization solutions for elite clients such as *Franklin Templeton*, *Acuity*, *Associated Press*. All the projects are part of Microsoft's Azure services now.
